# DNA Sequence Matching: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)
This project contains two dynamic programming approaches for solving the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem between two DNA sequences. The LCS problem identifies the longest sequence that can be derived by deleting some characters (without reordering) from both strings.

## Problem Description
Given two DNA sequences, the task is to find the length of their Longest Common Subsequence (LCS). This is useful in fields such as bioinformatics for comparing DNA, RNA, or protein sequences.

#### Example
For the input DNA sequences:
1. "XXXXXXXXXX"
2. "GTGTTCCCGTCXAAA"
the output will be: 1

## How to run
To run the script, simply execute the following into your terminal: python DNAMatch.py
